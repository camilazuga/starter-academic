abstract: The Na/K pump hydrolyzes ATP to export three intracellular Na (Na i) as
  it imports two extracellular K (Ko) across animal plasma membranes. Within the protein,
  two ion-binding sites (sites I and II) can reciprocally bind Na or K, but a third
  site (site III) exclusively binds Na in a voltage-dependent fashion. In the absence
  of Nao and Ko, the pump passively imports protons, generating an inward current
  (I H). To elucidate the mechanisms of IH, we used voltage-clamp techniques to investigate
  the [H]o, [Na]o, and voltage dependence of IH in Na/K pumps from ventricular myocytes
  and in ouabain-resistant pumps expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Lowering pH o revealed
  that Ho both activates IH (in a voltage-dependent manner) and inhibits it (in a
  voltage-independent manner) by binding to different sites. Nao effects depend on
  pHo; at pHo where no Ho inhibition is observed, Nao inhibits IH at all concentrations,
  but when applied at pHo that inhibits pump-mediated current, low [Na]o activates
  I H and high [Na]o inhibits it. Our results demonstrate that IH is a property inherent
  to Na/K pumps, not linked to the oocyte expression environment, explains differences
  in the characteristics of I H previously reported in the literature, and supports
  a model in which 1), protons leak through site III; 2), binding of two Na or two
  protons to sites I and II inhibits proton transport; and 3), pumps with mixed Na/proton
  occupancy of sites I and II remain permeable to protons. ?? 2014 Biophysical Society.
